 <em>Our early relationship with our mother has life-lasting consequences. A feel-good life is not necessarily a healthy one. Stress can be good for us. Speaking in a foreign language changes your decisions</em>
 <br>
 <i>Their are a several type of Human Physchology Facts-- </i>
 <br>
 <h3>Attraction Facts-</h3>
 <br>
 <p><em><blockquote>&#8226;<q>Attraction is the power of eliciting feelings of desire, interest, or liking. The psychology of attraction refers to the study of the reasons why we're attracted to certain people over others.</q>
    <br>

     <br>
     <h4 style="text-align: right ;">Attraction comes down to more than just sight.
A study published in Frontiers of Psychology says that people are able to discern a number of characteristics about a potential partner — including weight, dominance level, and emotional state — simply by listening to them speak.</h4>

<br>

    Attraction, as it turns out, is not a singular model. While there are countless variations and potencies, seven stand out as the major types of attraction "I tend to define attraction as forces which pull people together," explains social psychology expert Madeleine A. Fugère, Ph.D. "These forces can be things like liking, sexual desire, similarity, or even just physical proximity."

Sexual attraction, for example, is dictated by the desire to engage in intimate acts with a person and can be influenced by physical cues alone. Romantic attraction is deeper, spurred by feelings of wanting a relationship with someone. The two appear together in what is commonly considered "attraction." Friendship attraction is platonically just that, a desire to engage in a nonromantic companionate relationship. "We can be attracted to individuals because they are good listeners or interesting to talk to or funny but not be sexually attracted to those people," adds Fugère.

<h3>Body Language Facts-</h3>
<br>
<p><em><blockquote>&#8226;<q>According to Mehrabian, the spoken word communicates 7% of meaning. Your tone of voice communicates 38% of meaning, and your body language communicates 55% of meaning. Given how much we communicate via body language cues, learning how to understand them is essential if you're serious about being a good communicator</q>

<br>
<h4 style="text-align: right;"><i>This article discusses the roles played by body language in communication, as well as body language examples and the meaning behind them—so you know what to look for when you're trying to interpret nonverbal actions</i></h4>
<br>
Body language refers to the nonverbal signals that we use to communicate. These nonverbal signals make up a huge part of daily communication. In fact, body language may account for between 60% to 65% of all communication.1
Examples of body language include facial expressions, eye gaze, gestures, posture, and body movements. In many cases, the things we don't say can convey volumes of information.
So, why is body language important? Body language can help us understand others and ourselves. It provides us with information about how people may be feeling in a given situation. We can also use body language to express emotions or intentions.
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">Facial expressions, gestures, and eye gaze are often identified as the three major types of body language, but other aspects such as posture and personal distance can also be used to convey information. Understanding body language is important, but it is also essential to pay attention to other cues such as context. In many cases, you should look at signals as a group rather than focus on a single action.</p>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Facial Expressions</h3>
<br>
Think for a moment about how much a person is able to convey with just a facial expression. A smile can indicate approval or happiness. A frown can signal disapproval or unhappiness.

In some cases, our facial expressions may reveal our true feelings about a particular situation. While you say that you are feeling fine, the look on your face may tell people otherwise.

Just a few examples of emotions that can be expressed via facial expressions include:

<br>
<ol><li>Happiness</li>
<li>Sadness</li>
<li>Anger</li>
<li>Surprise</li>
<li>Disgust</li>
<li>Fear</li>
<li>Confusion</li>
<li>Excitement</li>
<li>Desire</li>
<Li>Contempt</Li>
</ol>
<br>
<mark>Facial expressions are also among the most universal forms of body language. The expressions used to convey fear, anger, sadness, and happiness are similar throughout the world.</mark>

<br>
<sub>One study found that individuals who had narrower faces and more prominent noses were more likely to be perceived as intelligent. People with smiling, joyful expression were also judged as being more intelligent than those with angry expressions.</sub>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Gestures</h3>
<br>
<img src="https://englishlive.ef.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/EN_2019_04_N1-585x1024.png" alt="gestures" width="500" height="550">
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">Gestures can be some of the most direct and obvious body language signals. Waving, pointing, and using the fingers to indicate numerical amounts are all very common and easy to understand gestures.

    Some gestures may be cultural, however, so giving a thumbs-up or a peace sign in another country might have a completely different meaning than it does in the United States.</p> 
<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>A clenched fist</b></li> can indicate anger in some situations or solidarity in others.
       <li><b>A thumbs up and thumbs down</b></li> are often used as gestures of approval and disapproval.10﻿
        <li><b>The "okay" gesture,</b></li> made by touching together the thumb and index finger in a circle while extending the other three fingers can be used to mean "okay" or "all right."10﻿ In some parts of Europe, however, the same signal is used to imply you are nothing. In some South American countries, the symbol is actually a vulgar gesture.
        <li><b>The V sign,</b></li> created by lifting the index and middle finger and separating them to create a V-shape, means peace or victory in some countries. In the United Kingdom and Australia, the symbol takes on an offensive meaning when the back of the hand is facing outward.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Arms and Legs</h3>
<br>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c1/59/32/c159329e119167f17dec364399f73a65.jpg" alt="arms and legs" width="500" height="500">
<br>
<p style="text-align: right;">The arms and legs can also be useful in conveying nonverbal information. Crossing the arms can indicate defensiveness. Crossing legs away from another person may indicate dislike or discomfort with that individual.

Other subtle signals such as expanding the arms widely may be an attempt to seem larger or more commanding, while keeping the arms close to the body may be an effort to minimize oneself or withdraw from attention.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Crossed arms might</b></li> indicate that a person feels defensive, self-protective, or closed-off.1
<li><b>Standing with hands placed on the hips</b></li> can be an indication that a person is ready and in control, or it can also possibly be a sign of aggressiveness.
<li><b> the hands behind the back</b></li> might indicate that a person is feeling bored, anxious, or even angry.
<li><b>Rapidly tapping fingers or fidgeting</b></li> can be a sign that a person is bored, impatient, or frustrated.
<li><b>Crossed legs</b></li> can indicate that a person is feeling closed-off or in need of privacy.    
</ul>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"> posture</h3>
<br>
<img src="https://www.verywellmind.com/thmb/_to6q4gJ5SrbCo6MZJS5qs6sYdc=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/illo_BodyLanguage-Posture-5984a3b99abed500102bc434.png" alt="posture" width="500" height="500">
<br>
<p style="text-align: right;">The term posture refers to how we hold our bodies as well as the overall physical form of an individual.</p>
<br>
Posture can convey a wealth of information about how a person is feeling as well as hints about personality characteristics, such as whether a person is confident, open, or submissive.

Sitting up straight, for example, may indicate that a person is focused and paying attention to what's going on. Sitting with the body hunched forward, on the other hand, can imply that the person is bored or indifferent.
<br>
When you are trying to read body language, try to notice some of the signals that a person's posture can send.
<br>
<ul>
<li>Open posture </li> keeping the trunk of the body open and exposed. This type of posture indicates friendliness, openness, and willingness.11
<li>>Closed posture</li>involves hiding the trunk of the body often by hunching forward and keeping the arms and legs crossed. This type of posture can be an indicator of hostility, unfriendliness, and anxiety.11
</ul>
<br>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong> Good body language, also known as positive body language, should convey interest and enthusiasm. Some ways to do this include maintaining an upright and open posture, keeping good eye contact, smiling, and nodding while listening </strong></p>
<br>
<br>
<h2> Personality Facts-</h2>
<br>
&#8226;<mark>Personality</mark>, a characteristic way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Personality embraces moods, attitudes, and opinions and is most clearly expressed in interactions with other people. It includes behavioral characteristics, both inherent and acquired, that distinguish one person from another and that can be observed in people’s relations to the environment and to the social group.
<br>
<img src="https://www.spring.org.uk/images/portrait-3.jpg" alt="personality" width="500" height="500">
<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong> of the most interesting psychological facts about personality is that your personality can be detected by smell alone. Individuals who are neurotic, extraverts, or dominant tend to have a specific smell that others can detect</strong></p>
<br>
Personality describes the unique patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that distinguish a person from others. A product of both biology and environment, it remains fairly consistent throughout life.

Examples of personality can be found in how we describe other people's traits. For instance, "She is generous, caring, and a bit of a perfectionist," or "They are loyal and protective of their friends."

The word "personality" stems from the Latin word persona, which refers to a theatrical mask worn by performers to play roles or disguise their identities.
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Consistency: </li> is generally a recognizable order and regularity to behaviors. Essentially, people act in the same way or in similar ways in a variety of situations.
        <li>Both psychological and physiological:</li> Personality is a psychological construct, but research suggests that it is also influenced by biological processes and needs.
       <li> Affects behaviors and actions:</li> Personality not only influences how we move and respond in our environment, but it also causes us to act in certain ways.
        <li>Multiple expressions:</li> Personality is displayed in more than just behavior. It can also be seen in our thoughts, feelings, close relationships, and other social interactions.
</ul>
<br>
<p style="text-align: initial;">Although there are many definitions of personality, most focus on the pattern of behaviors and characteristics that can help predict and explain a person's behavior.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Love Fact-</h2>
<br>
Less than a second after looking at someone we love, the brain releases chemicals such as oxytocin and dopamine. Together, they provide a sense of intense happiness and well-being. Kissing helps us choose who we will love. It is a big player in maintaining long-lasting love.
<br>
<br>
<img src="https://themindsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Love-IS-NOT-blind.jpg" alt="love fact" width="500" height="500">
<br>

<p style="text-align: right;"><strong> most people, love and relationships are the key components of a satisfying life. In fact, many of us have lasting connections with other people, including romantic ones, among our main priorities in life.

    If you’re looking for a healthy relationship and want to reach a true understanding with your partner, it can be helpful to know some scientific facts about love.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <h3>Love is really "on the brain"</h3>
    <br>
    Another interesting finding pertaining to love facts is that couples are so connected that their brain activity reveals their love for each other. A recent study in Frontiers in Psychology explored the neurological indicators of romantic love in newlywed couples.

Study results found that three brain chemicals: oxytocin, dopamine, and vasopressin were involved in bonding and love among newlywed partners. More specifically, romantic love is maintained through the release of these brain chemicals. For instance, when a person looks at a picture of their spouse, there is a release of dopamine, which is associated with feelings of pleasure.

<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>
The study also found that genes involved in the activity of oxytocin and vasopressin were linked to romantic love, suggesting that some people may be genetically more wired for bonding with a partner. So, it’s no surprise that people may experience love differently and have completely different needs in a relationship.</strong></p>

<br>
<h3>Long-term love is possible</h3>
<br>
it’s not uncommon for people to believe that passion and intimacy fade over time in the course of long-term relationships and marriages. Still, the truth is that romance doesn’t always dwindle away over time. In fact, in a study of married individuals, <strong>40% of those married longer than 10 years reported they were still “intensely in love.”</strong>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>, what is the secret to keeping passion alive?</strong> The factors below were common in long-term couples who reported intense love for each other:</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Positive thoughts about one’s partner</li>
        <li>Thinking about the partner when apart</li>
       <li> Sexual intimacy</li>
        <li>Affectionate behavior toward each other</li>
        <li>Experiencing new activities together</li>
</ul>
<br>
The bottom line is that couples don’t have to grow apart over time. With intentional effort, marriages can stay passionate, just like in the beginning stages of a relationship.
<br>
<h3>Using science in your daily life</h3>
<br>
Knowing psychological facts about love is helpful, but it’s also beneficial to take this knowledge and put it into action to improve your relationship. There are some key takeaways from the facts above love discussed here, and they can be used to enhance your own relationship satisfaction.
<br>
<strong>Here’s what stands out:</strong>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>There is more to attraction than just outward appearance. Showing care and compassion for others can make you more attractive to a partner.</li>
    <li>Your brain is wired for long-term connection with a partner. If you feel especially happy when thinking of your significant other, you likely have a strong bond, rooted in biology. Taking steps to strengthen the bond by <strong> time together and continuing to learn about each other</strong> will reinforce the connection between the two of you.</li>
<li>If you aren’t exactly like your partner, this doesn’t mean the relationship is destined to fail. As long as you share common values in important areas, such as your beliefs about finances, family, and household duties, <strong> it’s perfectly okay if one of you is more outgoing than the other.</strong></li>
<li>You may be subconsciously drawn to people who remind you of your parents. It’s important to <strong>self-awareness of who you’re attracted too,</strong> and whether the people you choose are a good fit. Familiarity can attract you to people who aren’t necessarily healthy for you.</li>
<li>Empathy is essential for creating a solid foundation within your relationship. For a healthy bond, it’s important to make an effort to understand your partner’s emotional world.</li>
<li>Passion and love can be long-lasting, as long as <strong> you and your partner are committed</strong> to keeping the love alive. When you hit a rough patch or feel like you’re just going through the motions, make an effort to try new things together, spice things up in the bedroom, or incorporate more physical affection into your daily lives.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<strong style="text-align: end;">It’s also beneficial for you to engage in activities that increase your own happiness, as being generally satisfied with life leads to better satisfaction in relationships.
